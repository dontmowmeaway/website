    <p>Don't Mow Me Away is a Dutch initiative that aims to increase biodiversity, save the bees and reduce periods of drought with one simple advice: stop mowing your grass. Research has shown that unmowed grass helps create a diversity of animals and plants, and holds our ground water better. That helps minimize the impact of periods of drought. </p>

<p>Because we believe in working effectively with maximal impact, we focus our attention not just on individuals, but rather on larger players, such as companies and government institutions. Those often maintain large stretches of grass, after all, for example around buildings or alongside roads. We send letters to these organizations about the benefits of unmowed grass, and encourage other people to do the same. To help then, we have a toolkit with materials that can be used to convince organizations. </p>

    <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Help us</h3>
    <p>Do you want to help us? Here are some things you can do:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Note places that have grass that do not need to be mowed. Think of patches of grass alongside roads or next to buildings. Especially think of patches of grass that people are unlikely to sit on or have a picnic.</li>
      <li>Send a letter to the owner of the patch of grass. Our toolkit provides useful letter templates that you can send out. You can adjust them to your needs.</li>
      <li>If you do not want to send the letter yourself, you can also inform us by sending us <a href="mailto:dontmowmeaway@gmail.com">an email</a>. Please provide as much information as possible, such as a precise location and pictures of the strech(es) of grass.</li>
      <li>You can also help us by expanding our toolkit. Do you speak a language for which we do not have a letter yet? Please translate our letter and <a href="mailto:dontmowmeaway@gmail.com">send it to us</a>. Do you have another idea to expand our toolbox? Please also let us know!
      <li>Help us spread the word! By following our <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/don-t-mow-me-away/">LinkedIn page</a> or liking our posts, you can help us get our message across to as many people as possible!</li>
